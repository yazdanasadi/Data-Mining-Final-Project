# Data-Mining-Final-Project
---------------------------
In this Project i used the decision tree that has written from scratch and showing the Whole Tree for multiple datasets then
i compare the code with scikit-learn decision tree classifier!                                                                      

You should install: Scikit-learn and Pydot with numpy.

Also you can find Apriori algorithm and FP-Growth method that used to find frequently items in adult dataset
